### Vote to rank a list of options

By UmActually - Leonardo

This Python script facilitates the process of creating a ranked list, whether it's about your top N favorite albums, or the N priority items that you will bring to the trip. The program operates in the following manner:

1. The user inputs a list of options
2. A list of all possible pairs of options is generated
3. The user picks their favorite out of each pair
4. The list is then sorted by votes and displayed

Be very careful with edge cases. The algorithm has been programmed to hate the rebellious.

This is not a serious project.
